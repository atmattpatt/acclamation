Acclamation
===========

Acclamation is a web application designed to make retrospectives easier.  Retros can be incredibly useful; but with large teams, retros can become tedios and inefficient.  Instead of writing sticky notes and cramming around a white board, Acclamation allows teams to substitute technology for tedium.
